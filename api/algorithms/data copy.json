Joslyn gifted the building in 1955 to the city of Santa Monica in memory of his wife. Designed by architect Weldon J. Fulton, it sports exterior walls clad in chunky Palos Verdes stone, glass walls, sloping roofs, and projecting canopies and rafter beams, to create a distinctively midcentury appearance. Fulton also created the swooping font spelling out \u201cCamera Obscura\u201d and camera on tripod logo on the front. Similar features are found at the Montana and Fairview branch libraries and at the Zucky\u2019s building on Wilshire Blvd., also designed by Fulton. The Camera Obscura itself is quite a bit older \u2013 it was built by Robert F. Jones, nephew of Santa Monica city founder Senator John P. Jones, in 1898 and was moved up from the Beach."}, {"name": "Self Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine Temple", "duration": "120", "url": "https://www.inspirock.com/united-states/los-angeles/self-realization-fellowship-lake-shrine-temple-a4154269399", "photo": "background-image: url('https://s.inspirockcdn.com/ds10/photos/United States/1/self-realization-fellowship-lake-shrine-temple--2074500559.jpg')", "rating": 4.8, "tag": ["Outdoor Activity"], "address": "17190 Sunset Blvd, Pacific Palisades, CA 90272, USA", "description": "\n                            Self Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine Temple is located in Los Angeles.

The quarry ceased operation in the late 1920s, leaving the caves behind. The caves became known as the Bronson Caves after a nearby street, giving the area its more popular name of Bronson Canyon (the same street indirectly provided the stage name for actor Charles Bronson, who chose the name of the Bronson Gate at Hollywood's Paramount Studios, which in turn derived its name from Bronson Ave).Scenes of the main cave entrance are normally filmed in a manner that shows the entrance at an angle because the cave is actually a very short tunnel through the hill, with the rear opening easily visible in a direct shot. The most well-known appearance of the tunnel entrance is likely as the entrance to the Batcave in the Batman television series of the 1960s."}, {"name": "Griffith Observatory", "duration": "60", "url": "https://www.inspirock.com/united-states/los-angeles/griffith-observatory-a24443075", "photo": "background-image: url('https://s.inspirockcdn.com/ds10/photos/United States/1/griffith-observatory--245373208.jpg')", "rating": 4.6, "tag": ["Must See", "Observatory"], "address": "2800 E Observatory Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA", "description": "\n                            Explore the wonders of our solar system and the galaxy at Griffith Observatory.
