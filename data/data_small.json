    "description": "Head downtown to see Bradbury Building and star in your own film noir. Originally designed by Sumner Hunt, Bradbury Building has been standing tall since 1893 when a millionaire businessman Lewis L. Bradbury commissioned it from George Wyman. Added to the list of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission, the building played a starring role in many music videos of artists like Janet Jackson and Genesis, as well as various films. Take a stroll through the structure to admire the Romanesque style that rules the decor--including an interior central court--or ride the open-cage elevators for a unique experience. Use Inspirock's suggestions to plan your Los Angeles trip and find the best activities and attractions for your vacation."}
